# Secret scanning: generic password detection - limited beta

Welcome to the beta of generic password detection for secret scanning. We're excited for you to test out and provide feedback as we iterate on the feature. Access to this beta is provided through a waitlist -- [sign up if you're not already a participant](https://github.com/features/preview/security)!

### Getting started  

During the beta, you'll need to [set an enterprise policy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-code-security-and-analysis-for-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-to-manage-the-use-of-generic-secret-detection-for-secret-scanning-in-your-enterprises-repositories) to manage the use of generic secret detection for secret scanning. Then, you'll need to enable AI detection in the security settings of each individual repository where you'd like to detect passwords. Enabling for all repositories at the organization and enterprise level are to come. 

Once enabled, detected passwords [will appear in the "Other" tab](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning#viewing-alerts-for-generic-secrets-detected-using-ai) of your secret scanning alerts. Be sure to resolve alerts with the appropriate reason -- our engineering team will use data on the false positive rate to improve the model and increase precision over time.
